## Instrument Landing System (ILS) ÔÉÅ

This project is a practical introduction to radio frequency techniques. It is aimed at electronics engineers. Readers will learn to apply basic concepts such as amplitude modulation, demodulation, filtering, etc. They will become familiar with the processing used in software-defined radio.

The language used for these lessons is Python. No in-depth knowledge of code is necessary. Each lesson is organized around a jupyter notebook that readers can download and modify to try out the concepts presented for themselves.
